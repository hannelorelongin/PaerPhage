# Structural variant analysis

This folder contains the necessary scripts for:

- benchmark 1: comparing long read alignment tools (seperate directory)
- benchmark 2: comparing SV following different long read alignment tools (seperate directory)
- SNP analysis (snippy.sh, envs/snippyEnv.yml)
- SV analysis for within colony mobility (Snakefile, envs/*usedTools*Env.yml)

*usedTools* : ngmlr, samtools

Please note that for general SV analysis the results were already created in the second benchmarking.
