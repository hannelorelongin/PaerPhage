# Annotation and population structure

This folder contains the necessary scripts for:
- genome annotation with Prokka (Snakefile, config.yml, envs/prokkaEnv.yml)
- pangenome analysis and core genome alignment with Roary (singleUseCommands_RoaryIQTree.md, envs/roaryEnv.yml)
- phylogenetic inference with IQTree (singleUseCommands_RoaryIQTree.md, envs/iqtreeEnv.yml)
