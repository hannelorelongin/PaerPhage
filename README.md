Code repository for master thesis 

*"Novel computational methods for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa viruses" - June 2021, KU Leuven*

Thesis research conducted at the lab of Computational Systems Biology (prof. Vera van Noort) and Lab of Gene Technology (prof. Rob Lavigne) under daily supervision of CÃ©dric Lood.

---
The project consist of bacterial genome **assembly**, then **annotation and determination of population structure**, followed by the exploration of two novel approaches for identifying prophages.
One method exploits the availability of long reads and its capability to highlight **structural variations** in genomes. 
The other strategy utilizes **viromics** datasets to pin down regions of possible viral origin.

Code is deposited in distinct folders for each seperate stage.
